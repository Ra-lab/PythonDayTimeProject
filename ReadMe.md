# PythonDayTimeProject
An executable batch file Python program which shows the day and time of the searched place.

# Instruction on how to run the program:
Double-click "DayTime.bat" to run the program, ensuring the correct path to the Python program file.

The repository has two files:
1. "DayTime.bat": The main executable batch file, which will run the "DayTimePython.pyw" Python code file.
2. "DayTimePython.pyw": The file that contains the Python code for the program.

# DayTime.bat Breakdown:

This script is a Windows batch file that automates the process of running a Python script.  
What each line does:

1. `@echo off`: Hides the commands from being displayed in the Command Prompt when the script runs, making it look cleaner.
   
2. `start pythonw C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\DayTimePython.pyw`: 
   - The `start` command opens a new window to run a program.
   - `pythonw` is used to run Python scripts without showing the Command Prompt window (useful for GUI-based Python programs or background tasks).
   - `C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\DayTimePython.pyw` is the path to the Python script being executed.

3. `exit`: Closes the batch file after the command has been executed.

## Commands:

- pythonw: A Windows-specific interpreter that runs Python scripts without opening a console window.  
  Can be used with both `.py` and `.pyw` files to suppress the console.

- .pyw: A file extension designed for Python scripts intended to run without a console window on Windows.  
  When double-clicked, `.pyw` files are automatically executed using `pythonw.exe`.

The batch file ensures that the script runs in a no-console mode, and if youâ€™re working in an environment where `.pyw` is not correctly associated with `pythonw.exe` (e.g., a misconfigured system), using `pythonw` ensures the no-console behavior.
